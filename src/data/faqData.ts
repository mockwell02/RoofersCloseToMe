        question: "How much does it cost to replace a roof?",
        answer: "Roof replacement costs vary widely depending on factors like material, roof size, and labor. On average, it ranges from $5,000 to $12,000, but high-end materials like metal or slate can exceed $30,000.",

      },
      {
        question: "What is the average lifespan of a roof?",
        answer: "It depends on the material: asphalt shingles last 20–30 years, metal roofs 40–70 years, and slate or tile over 100 years with proper care.",
